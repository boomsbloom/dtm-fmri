Timeseries for HCP working memory data are all that is available on the github repo. Timeseries for the math longitudinal and optogenetic datasets can be found in the project directory on sherlock.

Before running a SAX job, make sure to change:
  1) Number of subjects in run_wrapper.sh
  2) The timeseries that is loaded and the output text directory in runSAX.m
